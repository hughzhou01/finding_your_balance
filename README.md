The cyber-physical system 'Finding your balance(FYB)' is an interactive game that comedically simulates the daily experience of emotional ups and downs. FYB is composed of 2 main parts, a PID-controlled ball balancing system and a robot arm that displays emotional movements according to the player's facial expressions. When the 2 parts interact with each other, the balancing ball symbolises a person's fluctuating mental state, while the robot arm that dances or pushes the ball symbolises emotional events which interfere with the mental state.
